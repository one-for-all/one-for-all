Hi 👋 My name is Jay Li
=======================

Robotics Simulation Engineer & Solo Founder
-------------------------------------------

I was born in Zhoushan, China. I always liked physics as a kid, and used to think that if I learn all of physics, I could explain the whole world. (which turns out to be untrue... :))

I had my first experience of robotics after I went to U.S. for undergraduate and joined a robotics club. Since then I had worked on many kinds of robots, including underwater robot, robot arm, drone, quadruped, bionic hand.

I finished my master degree focused on robotics, and then joined a robotics startup that went public, and later worked on database service at a big tech.

Afterwards, I quit my job and explored a couple different ideas including podcast discovery app and AI image generation, but realized that these are not the things I would actually want to work on for life.

With that "epiphany", I am now fully committed to working on robotics simulation, and would happily do so for the rest of my life. Maybe I can't explain the world with physics, but I will simulate a good part of the world with physics for the purpose of robotics :).
